The Amazon rainforest, often referred to as the "lungs of the Earth," is the largest tropical rainforest in the world. It is home to an incredibly diverse range of plant and animal species, many of which are found nowhere else. The forest also plays a vital role in regulating the global climate by absorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide. However, deforestation due to logging, agriculture, and mining is threatening this delicate ecosystem. Efforts are being made globally to protect the Amazon, but challenges remain due to political, economic, and social factors.
