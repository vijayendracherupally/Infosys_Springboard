<Text Summarization, Paraphrasing & Similarity Analysis using Transformers>

This project demonstrates how to perform text summarization, paraphrasing, and semantic similarity scoring using multiple Transformer-based NLP models such as T5, BART, and Pegasus.
It loads two input text files, applies various models for summarization and paraphrasing, and then visualizes their similarity scores through bar charts.
